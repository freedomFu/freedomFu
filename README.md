## About Me

Hello there🫡! Wish you have a nice day 😁

My name is Yanduo Fu (付彦铎 in Chinese). I am currently a third-year Eng.D candidate at [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/).

✨ In life, I prefer to engage in some gentle exercises, such as health-preserving basketball, yoga, strength training, jogging, reading, and listening to the same piece of music repeatedly. I also occasionally play single-player games.

🧗 **Motto:** Do it anyway.

## Research Interests

I'm currently intrigued by the fields of network measurement and digital forensics. I aspire to leverage my technical skills to safeguard the security of the internet and the privacy of its users.
