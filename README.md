Hello there🫡! Wish you have a nice day 😁 My name is Yanduo Fu (付 彦铎 in Chinese).

My name is Yanduo Fu (付彦铎 in Chinese). I am currently a third-year Eng.D candidate in the [CSS Lab](https://github.com/CSSLabNKU) at [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/), fortunate to be supervised by [Professor Ding Wang](http://wangdingg.weebly.com/). Prior to this, I earned a joint Master of Engineering degree with the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/)), and the Institute of Information Engineering ([IIE](https://www.iie.ac.cn/)), Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Senior Engineer Qiongxiao Wang](https://dblp.org/pid/52/8379.html) in the research team led by [Professor Jingqiang Lin](https://lin-jingqiang.github.io/). During this period, I also participated in an academic seminar led by [Associate Professor Bingyu Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bingyu-Li-12). Additionally, I have been interning with [Associate Professor Huawei Mei's Dreamtech group](https://dreamtech.team/) since my sophomore year at North China Electric Power University ([NCEPU](https://net.ncepu.edu.cn/)) in Baoding.

🌞 Whoever reads this message, I want to tell you are amazing, you are loved, you are worthy. Everything is temporary and you will come out of this hard time shining.​

✨ In life, I prefer to engage in some gentle exercises, such as health-preserving basketball, yoga, strength training, jogging, reading, and listening to the same piece of music repeatedly. I also occasionally play single-player games.

🧗 Leaving behind a memory, after being tempered by scientific research, I feel that I am more suitable for work.
